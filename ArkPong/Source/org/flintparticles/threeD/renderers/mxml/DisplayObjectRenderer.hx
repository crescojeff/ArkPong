/**
 * The DisplayObjectRenderer is a native Flint 3D renderer that draws particles
 * as display objects in the renderer. The particles are drawn face-on to the
 * camera, with perspective applied to position and scale the particles.
 * 
 *<p>Particles may be represented by any DisplayObject and each particle 
 * must use a different DisplayObject instance. The DisplayObject
 * to be used should not be defined using the SharedImage initializer
 * because this shares one DisplayObject instance between all the particles.
 * The ImageClass initializer is commonly used because this creates a ArkPongMain
 * DisplayObject for particle.</p>
 * 
 *<p>The DisplayObjectRenderer has mouse events disabled for itself and any 
 * display objects in its display list. To enable mouse events for the renderer
 * or its children set the mouseEnabled or mouseChildren properties to true.</p>
 * 
 *<p>Because the DisplayObject3DRenderer directly uses the particle's image,
 * it is not suitable in situations where the same particle will be displayed 
 * by two different renderers.</p>
